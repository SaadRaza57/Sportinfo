            <h2>About Golf</h2>
            <p><span>Golf</span> is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
                Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 41⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or "sand traps"), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.

                Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.

          <p><h2>History</h2>Golf originated from a game played on the eastern coast of Scotland, in an area close to the royal capital of Edinburgh. In those early days players would attempt to hit a pebble over sand dunes and around tracks using a bent stick or club. During the 15th century, Scotland prepared to defend itself, yet again, against an invasion by the ‘Auld Enemy’. The nation’s enthusiastic pursuit of golf however, led many to neglect their military training, so much so that the Scottish parliament of King James II banned the sport in 1457.

            Although people largely ignored the ban, it was only in 1502 that the game gained the royal seal of approval when King James IV of Scotland (1473 -1513) became the world’s first golfing monarch.

            The popularity of the game quickly spread throughout 16th century Europe thanks to this royal endorsement. King Charles I brought the game to England and Mary Queen of Scots (pictured to the right) introduced the game to France when she studied there; the term ‘caddie’ derives from the name for her French military aides, known as cadets.

            One of the premier golf courses of the day was at Leith near Edinburgh which hosted the first international golf match in 1682, when the Duke of York and George Patterson representing Scotland, beat two English noblemen.

            <h2>Masters Tournament</h2>  <p>Masters Tournament, invitational golf tournament held annually since 1934 from Thursday through Sunday during the first full week of April at the private Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. The tournament was conceived by American golfer Bobby Jones. It is considered one of the four “majors”—the other major golf tournaments being the U.S. Open, the British Open (Open Championship), and the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) Championship. It is the only one of them played annually at the same site. Most of the entrants are professionals, although a few amateurs are invited each year.

            In 1930, at age 28, Jones retired from competitive golf and formed a consortium with Wall Street financier Clifford Roberts. They bought a 365-acre (150-hectare) commercial nursery in Augusta for $70,000 with the goal of creating an exclusive golf club—with no swimming pool and no tennis courts. The 72-hole golf course was planned by the noted English designer Alister MacKenzie. The club opened in early 1933 with a members’ tournament commemorating the occasion. One year later, Jones expanded the tournament, and the Masters was born. </p>

            <h2>About Football</h2>
            <p><span>sportsinfo</span> football, also called association football or soccer, game 
                in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands 
                and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper
                 is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area
                  surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.
                Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and
                 spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be
                  played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to
                   gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing 
                   body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that
                    at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football
                     players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined
                      television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier
                       tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history. The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although various versions of the game were spread over large regions. In some ritual occasions, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. A unique feature of the Mesoamerican ball game versions was a bouncing ball made of rubber – no other early culture had access to rubber.The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball (stitched leather with fur or feathers inside) on an area of a square. A modified form of this game later spread to Japan and was by the name of kemari practiced under ceremonial forms.</p>

            <h2>FiFa Worldcup</h2>
            <p>World Cup, formally FIFA World Cup, in football (soccer), quadrennial tournament that determines the sport’s world champion. It is likely the most popular sporting event in the world, drawing billions of television viewers every tournament.The first competition for the cup was organized in 1930 by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and was won by Uruguay. Held every four years since that time, except during World War II, the competition consists of international sectional tournaments leading to a final elimination event made up of 32 national teams. Unlike Olympic football, World Cup teams are not limited to players of a certain age or amateur status, so the competition serves more nearly as a contest between the world’s best players. Referees are selected from lists that are submitted by all the national associations.The trophy cup awarded from 1930 to 1970 was the Jules Rimet Trophy, named for the Frenchman who proposed the tournament. This cup was permanently awarded in 1970 to then three-time winner Brazil (1958, 1962, and 1970), and a new trophy called the FIFA World Cup was put up for competition.</p>
